method has to change from using ResourceBundle to using Utf8ResourceBundle in the following line (~#232)\n\n\n\nreturn Utf8ResourceBundle.getBundle(aBundleName, locale, Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader());\n\n\n\nNote that even with the above patch, we have to add dummy text to the first line of the .properties file to skip the byte-order-mark, e.g.:\n\n\n\n# dummy header line to skip byte-order-mark\n\nmy.label=Hello

Mike McCandless, sne of the Lucene developers, wrote a really nice post about new things in this version of Lucene.  The part that I think is interesting for HBase, and that HBase devs may want to look at (and borrow to use with compactions) is this:\r\n\r\nReducing merge IO impact \r\n\r\nMerging (consolidating many small segments into a single big one) is a very IO and CPU intensive operation which can easily interfere with ongoing searches. In 4.0.0 we now have two ways to reduct this impact:\r\n        * Rate-limit the IO caused by ongoing merging, by calling FSDirectory.setMaxMergeWriteMBPerSec. \r\n\r\n\r\n        * Use the new NativeUnixDirectory which bypasses the OS's IO cache for all merge IO, by using direct IO. This ensures that a merge won't evict hot pages used by searches.

The current code of hive, optimizations are all done after generating DAG of operators. It is a awful design and makes me mad. For example, the map-side optimization, it scans the whole operators' DAG and try to find the operators that can be replaced by map-operation and then replace it. How terrible and stupid the code is!!! The terrible code expands to 1000 lines, and only implements the map-side optimizations!!! \r\nIn my opinion, optimization shouldn't be done in a separated step, differnt optimization should be done in appropriate time. For example, join reorder, should be done when we parse the input query, and we can generate Map-Reduce operators or only Map-Operator for each join according to the cost estimation. And, in the process, we can do join and aggreagation merge, and, we shoud push down predicate in proper time and generate proper data sturcture, to insure the cose-estimation module can fetch corresponding predicate of each base table for estimating JOIN cost. How concise and graceful the code will be if we do the optimization this way!!!  But Now, in order to complying with the Optimiser framework of Hive, I have to write lots of ugly code with amazing redundancy, and, the code is very very difficult to debug!!!! Now there is a patch of cost-based JOIN reorder and merge optimizer called YSMART, I glance at it. It use 6000+ code and is difficult to read!! And it's optimization is incompleted.\r\nThe optimizer architecture of Hive is terrible, How can I do

issues have been raised about the current behaviour of the \"Complex\" class, located in package \"o.a.c.m.complex\" (e.g. MATH-657, MATH-620).\r\nThe ensuing discussion revealed various, sometimes incompatible, requirements with focus on efficiency or consistency or backwards compatibility or comparison with other math packages (Octave) or faithfulness to standards (C99x).\r\n\r\nIt is thus proposed to create several classes, each with a clearly defined purpose.\r\n\r\nThe consensus seems to be that the first task is to implement a new \"BasicComplex\" class where the computational formulae (for computing real and imaginary part of a complex) will be applied directly without worrying about limiting cases (NaNs and infinities). Doing so will automatically produce a behaviour similar to the Java {{double}} primitive. It is also assumed that it will be the most efficient implementation for \"normal\" use (i.e. not involving limiting cases).\r\nThis task would consist in copying most of the code in the existing \"Complex\" class over to \"BasicComplex\". And similarly with \"ComplexTest\". Then, in \"BasicComplex\", one would remove all variables that refer to NaNs and infinities together with checks and special assignments, and adapt the unit tests along the way.\r\n\r\nA new \"ExtendedComplex\" class would inherit from \"BasicComplex\". This class would aim at representing the compactified space of the complex numbers (one point-at-infinity).\r\n\r\nA new \"C99Complex\" class would inherit from \"BasicComplex\". This class would aim at implementing the C99x standard.","priority":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/4","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/minor.png","name":"Minor","id":"4"},"customfield_12311120":null,"customfield_12310420":"2185","duedate":null,"issuelinks":[{"id":"12351536","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issueLink/12351536","type":{"id":"12310010","name":"Incorporates","inward":"is part of","outward":"incorporates","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/12310010"},"outwardIssue":{"id":"12554203","key":"MATH-788","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12554203","fields":{"summary":"Complex bug with NaN: the operation new Complex(0.0).multiply(new Complex(Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY)) gives (Infinity, Infinity) instead of NaN","status":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

The sparse SVD avoids computing the unnecessary data, and more importantly, has significantly lower computational complexity, which allows it to scale to larger matrices.\r\n\r\nOther linear algebra implementation have support for the sparse svd.

does not have a way to run long running computational tasks across the cluster. We can piggyback on the mapreduce paradigm so that users have smooth learning curve.\r\n\r\n * The mapreduce component will be written as a RequestHandler in Solr\r\n * Works only in SolrCloud mode. (No support for standalone mode) \r\n * Users can write MapReduce programs in Javascript or Java. First cut would be JS ( ? )\r\n\r\nh1. sample word count program\r\n\r\nh2.how to invoke?\r\n\r\nhttp://host:port/solr/collection-x/mapreduce?map=<map-script>&reduce=<reduce-script>&sink=collectionX\r\n\r\nh3. params \r\n* map :  A javascript implementation of the map program\r\n* reduce : a Javascript implementation of the reduce program\r\n* sink : The collection to which the output is written. If this is not passed , the request will wait till completion and respond with the output of the reduce program and will be emitted as a standard solr response. . If no sink is passed the request will be redirected to the \"reduce node\" where it will wait till the process is complete. If the sink param is passed ,the rsponse will contain an id of the run which can be used to query the status in another command.\r\n* reduceNode : Node name where the reduce is run . If not passed an arbitrary node is chosen\r\n\r\n\r\nThe node which received the command would first identify one replica from each slice where the map program is executed . It will also identify one another node from the same collection where the reduce program is run. Each run is given an id and the details of the nodes participating in the run will be written to ZK (as an ephemeral node). \r\n\r\nh4. map script \r\n\r\n{code:JavaScript}\r\nvar res = $.streamQuery(*:*);//this is not run across the cluster. //Only on this index\r\nwhile(res.hasMore()){\r\n  var doc = res.next();\r\n  var txt = doc.get(“txt”);//the field on which word count is performed\r\n  var words = txt.split(\" \");\r\n   for(i = 0; i < words.length; i++){\r\n\t$.map(words[i],{‘count’:1});// this will send the map over to //the reduce host\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nEssentially two threads are created in the 'map' hosts . One for running the program and the other for co-ordinating with the 'reduce' host . The maps emitted are streamed live over an http connection to the reduce program\r\n\r\nh4. reduce script\r\n\r\nThis script is run in one node . This node accepts http connections from map nodes and the 'maps' that are sent are collected in a queue which will be polled and fed into the reduce program. This also keeps the 'reduced' data in memory till the whole run is complete. It expects a \"done\" message from all 'map' nodes before it declares the tasks are complete. After  reduce program is executed for all the input it proceeds to write out the result to the 'sink' collection or it is written straight out to the response.\r\n\r\n{code:JavaScript}\r\nvar pair = $.nextMap();\r\nvar reduced = $.getCtx().getReducedMap();// a hashmap\r\nvar count = reduced.get(pair.key());\r\nif(count === null) {\r\n  count = {“count”:0};\r\n  reduced.put(pair.key(), count);\r\n}\r\ncount.count += pair.val().count ;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh4.example output\r\n{code:JavaScript}\r\n{\r\n“result”:[\r\n“wordx”:{ \r\n         “count”:15876765\r\n         },\r\n“wordy” : {\r\n           “count”:24657654\r\n          }\r\n \r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nTBD\r\n* The format in which the output is written to the target collection, I assume the reducedMap will have values mapping to the schema of the collection\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","priority":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/3","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/major.png","name":"Major","id":"3"},"customfield_12311120":null,"customfield_12310420":"339543","duedate":null,"issuelinks":[],"watches":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/SOLR-5069/watchers","watchCount":15,"isWatching":false},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"subtasks":[],"status":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/1","description":"The issue is open and ready for the assignee to start work on it.","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/statuses/open.png","name":"Open","id":"1"},"labels":[],"workratio":-1,"assignee":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=noble.paul","name":"noble.paul","emailAddress":"noble.paul@gmail.com","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Noble Paul","active":true},"customfield_12310222":null,"customfield_12310220":"2013-07-23 15:29:31.479","aggregatetimeestimate":null,"project":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/project/SOLR","id":"12310230","key":"SOLR","name":"Solr","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=small&pid=12310230&avatarId=10057","48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?pid=12310230&avatarId=10057"}},"versions":[],"customfield_12310920":"339526","environment":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"timeestimate":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"lastViewed":null,"components":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/component/12313841","id":"12313841","name":"SolrCloud"}],"customfield_10010":null,"customfield_12310310":"0.0","timeoriginalestimate":null,"aggregatetimespent":null}},{"expand":"editmeta,renderedFields,transitions,changelog,operations","id":"12659598","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12659598","key":"SOLR-5073","fields":{"progress":{"progress":0,"total":7200,"percent":0},"summary":"Improve SolrQuery class and add support for facet limit on per field basis in SolrJ","issuetype":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issuetype/4","id":"4","description":"An improvement or enhancement to an existing feature or task.","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/issuetypes/improvement.png","name":"Improvement","subtask":false},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/SOLR-5073/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"fixVersions":[],"resolution":null,"resolutiondate":null,"timespent":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandrozbinden","name":"sandrozbinden","emailAddress":"sandrozbinden@gmail.com","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sandrozbinden&avatarId=17095","48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sandrozbinden&avatarId=17095"},"displayName":"Sandro Mario Zbinden","active":true},"aggregatetimeoriginalestimate":7200,"customfield_12310300":null,"updated":"2013-07-25T14:19:40.000+0000","created":"2013-07-24T15:35:10.000+0000","description":"Currently the SolrQuery (org.apache.solr.client.solrj) class supports the setFacetLimit(int limit) and getFacetLimit() method. \r\n\r\nRecently someone added a feature to specifiy the facet.limit on a per field basis.
